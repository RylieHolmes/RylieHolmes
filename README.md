# Hi, I'm Rylie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UK-based developer with a lifelong passion for computers and coding. My interest started at a young age and led me to formalize my skills at Broadstairs College and online coding courses, where I dove deep into Python development. I love the challenge of building a complete application from an idea to a polished final product. You also may notice that i dont have many project's and the  uploads are recent. I created this account some time ago for general use and have only just begun to showcase my work here.
