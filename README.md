# Hi, I'm Rylie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UK-based developer who got into coding at a young age and never looked back. I built on that early interest with a formal education in college and various online courses to dive deeper into development, especially with Python. I really enjoy the entire process of building an application from the initial concept to the final, polished product.
A quick heads-up about my profile I know there aren't many projects here yet. I created this account a while back for personal use and I'm only now beginning to use it as a proper portfolio to share my work.
