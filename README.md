# Hi, I'm Rylie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UK-based developer with a lifelong passion for computers and coding. My interest started at a young age and led me to formalize my skills at Broadstairs College, where I dove deep into Python development. I love the challenge of building a complete application from an idea to a polished final product. You also may notice that i dont have many project's and the  uploads are recent. I created this account some time ago for general use and have only just begun to showcase my work here.
# What languages i know:

*   Proficient: Python
*   Sort Of Proficient(could polish): JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   Exploring/Sort Of Know: C++, C#, Rust

Check out my pinned *multi LM* projectâ€”it's a great example of the kind of work I'm passionate about!
