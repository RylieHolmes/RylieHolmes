# Hi, I'm Rylie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UK-based developer with a lifelong passion for computers and coding. My interest started at a young age and led me to formalize my skills at Broadstairs College, where I dove deep into Python development. I love the challenge of building a complete application from an idea to a polished final product. And if you are wonding why I dont have any projects uploaded for the past few years I only made this account for general use and just started uploading my projects.

# What languages i know:

*   Proficient: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   Exploring/sort of know: C++, C#, Rust

Check out my pinned *multi LM* projectâ€”it's a great example of the kind of work I'm passionate about!
